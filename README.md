# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## Prepare the Data:
* Use the `StandardScaler()` module from `scikit-learn` to normalize the data from the CSV file.
* Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
* Use the elbow method to find the best value for `k` using the following steps:
  * Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.
  * Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
  * Create a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of `k`.
  * Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
  * Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.
  * Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for `k`? Answer: 4

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
* Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data:
